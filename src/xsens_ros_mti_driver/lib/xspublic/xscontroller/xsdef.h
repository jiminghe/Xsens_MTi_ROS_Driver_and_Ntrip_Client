	\brief	Macros and types for use in the Xsens communication protocol and Xsens Device API classes

	This file contains useful macros for the Xsens Device API classes. These include
	Message Ids, sizes of messages, result/error codes, etc.

	The macros and enumerators in this file are either used on multiple levels (XsResultValue)
	or so numerous (XMID_...) that it would not be justifiable to put them in a header
	file of a particular level.
